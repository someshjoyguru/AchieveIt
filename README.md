## How I Implemented the Project?
1) First I created the ToDo App by applying basic react concepts of useState and useEffect.
2) Then I created a robust backend using node.js, express and many other JS libraries.
3) After deploying the backend (local system) and adjusting the cors settings I created the authentication system, tested thoroughly that each and every function/feature is working properly, I integrated the front end logic in the backend.

## Resources Used:
React Documentation, Used AI Tools for generating design templates and re-coded it as per my application, Some Past Project References, some bookmarked notes :)
